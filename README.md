# Borderlands_Config_utility
Borderlands 2 is FPS shooter developed by Gearbox Inc. in 2012. 
Developed using Unreal Engine 3, the initial graphics settings are stored in an .ini configuration file in My documents which is used to load graphical, audio, network and control settings on game launch. 
My configuration utility is a desktop app which uses javafx, scenebuilder and POJOs to make the process of editing the configuration file to improve game performance easier to non technically inclined people.
